        <h2>What is DDoS?</h2>
        <p>A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming the target with a flood of internet traffic.</p>

        <h2>How Does DDoS Work?</h2>
        <p>DDoS attacks typically follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The attacker uses a network of compromised devices (a botnet) to initiate the attack.</li>
            <li>The botnet floods the target with massive amounts of traffic.</li>
            <li>The targetâ€™s server or network becomes overwhelmed and unable to respond to legitimate traffic.</li>
            <li>The attacker continues to flood the target with traffic, causing service outages or downtime.</li>
            <li>The attacker may demand ransom or disrupt business operations until the target complies with their demands.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Common DDoS Tactics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Volume-Based Attacks:</strong> Overloading the network with large amounts of traffic (e.g., UDP floods).</li>
            <li><strong>Protocol Attacks:</strong> Disrupting the communication protocols of the target (e.g., SYN flood).</li>
            <li><strong>Application Layer Attacks:</strong> Targeting specific application functions to exhaust server resources (e.g., HTTP floods).</li>
            <li><strong>Botnets:</strong> Networks of infected devices used to carry out DDoS attacks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Spot a DDoS Attack</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Significant slowdown or unresponsiveness of your website or server.</li>
            <li>Unexpected spikes in traffic from unusual locations.</li>

        <h2>What Should You Do if You Suspect a DDoS Attack?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitor network traffic for abnormal spikes or unusual patterns.</li>
            <li>Contact your hosting provider or network administrator to investigate.</li>
            <li>Use DDoS mitigation services to filter out malicious traffic.</li>
            <li>Activate rate-limiting measures or temporary blocking of suspicious IP addresses.</li>

        <h2>How to Protect Yourself from DDoS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Implement DDoS protection and mitigation tools, such as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).</li>
            <li>Distribute your network infrastructure across multiple data centers or use cloud services with built-in DDoS protection.</li>
            <li>Use rate-limiting and geo-blocking techniques to limit traffic from specific regions.</li>
            <li>Ensure redundancy and failover systems are in place to maintain service availability during an attack.</li>
